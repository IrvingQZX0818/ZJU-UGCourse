    No. Data set should be divided into training set and test data. And we should not maximize the performance of the training set, but that of the test set.

## 2. Bayes Decision Rule
- (a)
    - (i)
        $$
        P(B_1=1)=\frac{1}{3}
        $$
    - (ii)
        $$
        P(B_2=0\mid B_1=1)=1
        $$
    - (iii)
        $$
        P(B_1=1\mid B_2=0)=\frac{P(B_2=0\mid B_1=1)+P(B_2=1\mid B_1=1)}{P(B_1=1)}=\frac{1}{2}
        $$
    - (iv)
        $$
        P(B_3=1\mid B_2=0)=P(B_1=1\mid B_2=0)=\frac{1}{2}
        $$
        So, after knowing B~2~ contains nothing, the probability of B~1~ and B~2~ containing the bonus is the same. So changing my choice or not are both okay.
