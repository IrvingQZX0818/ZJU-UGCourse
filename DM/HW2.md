    1. If the target problem is linearly separable, then the train error is 0.
    Respectively when the size of training data is:
        - 10
            The average train error rate is 0. The average test error rate is 11.3190%. 
        - 100
            The average train error is 0. The average test error rate is 1.3350%.
    1. The average number of iterations should converge to half of the number of training data. Respectively when the size of training data is:
        - 10
            The average number of iterations is 5.664.
        - 100
            The average number of iterations is 45.427.
    1. If the training data is not linearly separable, the algorithm will loop endless.
